# Service Worker Presentation

A presentation about using service workers to provide push notification and offline capabilities in React apps

## [View the Service Worker Presentation](https://rdeprey.github.io/Service-Workers-Presentation/)

## Demo

I made a demo app that shows one potential approach for implementing push notifications via a service worker in a React app. It uses Firebase Cloud Messaging, a Firebase Function, and a Firebase Firestore to implement the push notifications. It's no longer setup locally (to avoid cloud charges), but you can [view the code for the app and/or setup the demo in your own environment](https://github.com/rdeprey/service-worker-demo).

## Running the Presentation Locally

To run this slide deck:

1. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies
2. Run `npm start` on the command line in the root folder where the code is stored
3. Go to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
